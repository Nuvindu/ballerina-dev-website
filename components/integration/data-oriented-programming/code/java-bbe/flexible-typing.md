title: 'Model data as safe and flexible'
description: In data-oriented programming, the ability to model data in a secure and flexible manner is crucial. Ballerina's open and closed records offer a powerful mechanism to achieve this. <br><br>Closed records provide a secure and rigid structure with strictly defined field access, ensuring data integrity, type safety, and prevention of unintended modifications. <br><br>Open records, on the other hand, offer flexibility by allowing dynamic addition of fields. This enables handling evolving data structures where new fields can be introduced as needed.In Java, this dynamic behavior is not directly supported, and data structures usually require modification or the use of map-like structures to accommodate additional fields.
