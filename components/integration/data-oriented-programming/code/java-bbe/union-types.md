title: 'Union types'
description: Union types enable developers to define data structures that can hold values of different types. This flexibility allows for the representation of diverse data formats within a unified structure. As a result, the separation of code from data becomes more pronounced, facilitating easier manipulation and processing of heterogeneous data. <br>By embracing union types, data-oriented programming achieves a higher level of abstraction, enabling seamless integration and efficient handling of diverse data formats.
