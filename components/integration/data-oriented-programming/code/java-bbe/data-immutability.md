title: 'Data immutability'
description: Immutable data ensures data integrity, simplifies reasoning about code, and reduces the potential for unexpected side effects. <br><br>Ballerina and Java approach data immutability differently. While Ballerina promotes immutability by default, Java does not enforce immutability at the language level. Ballerina's focus on immutability makes it well-suited for data-oriented programming paradigms where maintaining the integrity and consistency of data is crucial.
