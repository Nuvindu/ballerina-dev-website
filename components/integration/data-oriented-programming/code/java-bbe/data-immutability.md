title: 'Data immutability'
description: Ballerina and Java approach data immutability differently. While Ballerina promotes immutability by default, Java does not enforce immutability at the language level. Immutable data ensures data integrity, simplifies reasoning about code, and reduces the potential for unexpected side effects. Ballerina's focus on immutability makes it well-suited for data-oriented programming paradigms where maintaining the integrity and consistency of data is crucial.
