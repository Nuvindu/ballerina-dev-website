title: 'JSON and XML support'
description: Ballerina has native support for working with JSON and XML data formats. It provides specialized types and built-in operators to handle these data structures. By abstracting the complexities of working with JSON and XML, Ballerina promotes data separation by providing high-level abstractions for data manipulation. <br>Java, on the other hand, does not have built-in support for JSON and XML. Developers have to use third-party libraries to work with these data formats.
