title: 'Table type'
description: Ballerina offers a compelling solution for separating code from data with its native support for the table type. The table type is specifically designed for storing and manipulating structured data. It allows you to define records as values and associate them with unique keys. In Java, the Map interface is used to store key-value pairs. <br> The key difference between Ballerina's table type and Java's Map is that the table type in Ballerina is specifically designed for structured data and has built-in support for record-based values.
