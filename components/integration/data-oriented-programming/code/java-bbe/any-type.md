title: 'Any type'
description: In Ballerina, you can represent data with generic data types using the `any` type. `any` means any value except an error value. You can use `any|error` for absolutely any value. This provides a way to represent data without specifying a specific type explicitly. In Java, you can use the `Object` class to represent any type of data.
