title: 'Type constraints'
description: Ballerina supports type constraints, allowing developers to specify additional constraints or validations on data types. Type constraints help enforce rules and requirements on data, promoting data integrity and separation. Developers can define constraints such as range checks, pattern validations, or custom validations.
