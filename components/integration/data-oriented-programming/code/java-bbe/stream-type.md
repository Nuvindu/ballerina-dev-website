title: 'Stream type'
description: Ballerina and Java provide powerful constructs for working with sequences of data through their stream types. Streams enhance data-oriented programming by enabling efficient and expressive manipulation of data in a streaming fashion resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code that is easier to understand and debug. This enhances the overall data-oriented programming experience.
