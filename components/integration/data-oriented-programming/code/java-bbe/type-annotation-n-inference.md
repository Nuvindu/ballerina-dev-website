title: 'Implicit and explicit typing'
description: Explicit typing allows developers to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values explicitly. This clarity aids in understanding the expected data types and promotes data separation. Type inference, on the other hand, automatically infers types based on assigned values, reducing the need for explicit annotations and making the code more concise.<br><br>Java and Ballerina both support explicit typing and type inference.
