title: 'Implicit and explicit typing'
description: Explicit typing allows developers to specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values explicitly, promoting clarity and facilitating data separation. Type inference, on the other hand, automatically deduces types based on assigned values, reducing the need for explicit type declarations and making the code more concise.<br><br>Java and Ballerina both support explicit typing and type inference.
