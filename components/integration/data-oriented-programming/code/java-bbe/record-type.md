title: 'Record type'
description: Both Java and Ballerina offer a powerful mechanism known as the `record` to define data structures and enable efficient data manipulation. <br>In Java, the record class was introduced in Java 14, allowing developers to define immutable data classes with ease. On the other hand, Ballerina has had built-in support for records right from the start, providing a seamless way to define structured data types. <br>The use of records in both languages helps in separating code from data, allowing for more modular and maintainable programs.
