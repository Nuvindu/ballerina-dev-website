When the number and/or depth of such components grow, it is convenient to have a holistic view of the system architecture represented graphically. \n\nThe Architecture View of the Ballerina VS Code extension provides a high-level picture of the components and their interactions in Ballerina projects purely based on the source code. The topics below demonstrate the Architecture View in detail.\n\n- [Explore the Architecture View](../design-the-application/explore-the-architecture-view.md)\n- [Design using the Architecture View](../design-the-application/design-using-the-architecture-view.md)\n","id":"index","sub":"","third":"","slug":"index","codes":"[]"},"__N_SSG":true}
