It allows you to look at your program logic holistically and comprehend the program at a glance. \n\nAlso, the Data Mapper allows you to visually translate data from one format to another (such as from one JSON format to another). It comes with an intuitive user interface and prevents the need to know the programming logic underneath.\n\nFor more detailed information on these tools, see the topics below.\n\n- [Sequence Diagram View](../implement-the-code/sequence-diagram-view.md)\n- [Data Mapper](../implement-the-code/data-mapper.md)","id":"index","sub":"","third":"","slug":"index","codes":"[]"},"__N_SSG":true}
